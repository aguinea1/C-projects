# ðŸ§  C Language Projects

Welcome to my curated collection of C programming projects.  
These works explore low-level systems programming, memory management, algorithm optimization, and concurrency.

All of these were built using pure C, with a strong emphasis on clean code, performance, and deep understanding of how things work under the hood.

## ðŸ“¦ Projects

### ðŸ”¹ [libft](https://github.com/aguinea1/libft)  
A custom C library that reimplements standard functions like `memcpy`, `strdup`, `atoi`, and more.  
Designed to be modular and reusable as a base for future C projects.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [get_next_line](https://github.com/aguinea1/get_next_line)  
A function that reads a file line by line from a given file descriptor.  
Carefully handles buffers, memory leaks, and edge cases.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [pipex](https://github.com/aguinea1/pipex)  
Recreates shell-like piping (e.g. `ls | grep .c`) using process forking, piping, and file descriptor manipulation.  
Great hands-on exploration of Unix system calls.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [Fract-ol](https://github.com/aguinea1/Fract-ol)  
Generates Mandelbrot and Julia fractals using the MiniLibX graphics library.  
Supports zooming, color themes, and real-time interaction.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [Push-Swap-WR](https://github.com/aguinea1/Push-Swap-WR)  
Solves a stack-based sorting challenge using a limited set of operations.  
This version sorts **500 random integers in just 4150 moves**, focusing on algorithmic efficiency.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [Push-Swap-Turco](https://github.com/aguinea1/Push-Swap-Turco)  
An alternative approach to the same sorting problem, experimenting with different strategies for optimization.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [minishell](https://github.com/aguinea1/minishell)  
A small shell implementation with support for pipes, redirections, built-in commands, and environment variables.  
Built from scratch to understand how terminals and interpreters work internally.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [Philosophers](https://github.com/aguinea1/Philosophers)  
A concurrency project simulating the dining philosophers problem using POSIX threads and mutexes.  
Focuses on synchronization, deadlock avoidance, and timing precision.
